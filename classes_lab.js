// ## Question 1

// a. Write a class called `Person` that has 3 properties: a first name, a last name and a middle name. 
// Create 2 instances of a `Person`. Print one of their first names.


// b. Write a method in `Person` called `fullName` that will return a formatted string of an 
// instance's full name. Call this method on both the instances you created in part a.


class Person{
    constructor(firstName, lastName, middleName){
        this.firstName = firstName
        this.lastName = lastName
        this.middleName = middleName

let andrea = new Person("Andrea", "McDonald", "Donrita");
console.log(jake.firstName);

class Jake extends Person{
};
console.log(jake.firstName + " " + jake.lastName);


// ## Question 2

// a. Create a class called `Book` that has properties `title`, `author` and `rating`. Create some instances of `Book`.


// b. Add a method to `Book` called `isGood` that returns `true` if its rating is greater than or equal to 7



class Books{
    constructor(title, author, rating){
        this.title = title
        this.author = author
        this.rating = rating
    };

        };
    };

console.log(iceHeart.isGood());


// ## Question 3

// a. Create a `Dog` class with four properties: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.

// b. Add a method called `playFetch`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to 
// `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and log "Ruff!"

// c. Add a method called `feed`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` 
// to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should log "The dog doesn't look hungry"

// d. Add a method called `toString` that returns a description of the dog:


class Dog{
    constructor(name, breed, mood, hungry){
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
        this.mood = mood;

// ## Question 4

// There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

// C = (F - 32) / 1.8
// F = 1.8 * C + 32
// K = C + 273

// a. Make an object called `freezingPoint` that has three properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. 
// Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.

let freezingPoint = {
    celsius: 0,
    fahrenheit: 32,
    Kelvin: 273
};
console.log("The water's freezing temperature :", freezingPoint);



// b. Make a class called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`.

// ```js
// let outsideTempt = new Celsius(10.0)
// outsideTempt.celsius //returns 10.0
// outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
// outsideTempt.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0
// ```
class Celsius{
    constructor(celsius){
        this.celsius = celsius
    }
    getFahrenheitTemp(){
        return 1.2 * this.celsius + 32
    }
    getKelvinTemp(){
        return this.celsius + 273
    }
    isBelowFreezing(){

    }
};

console.log("Outside temperature : ", outsideTempt.celsius, "C");
console.log("Outside temperature : ", outsideTempt.getFahrenheitTemp(), "F");
console.log("Outside temperature : ", outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp(), "K");


// c. Give `Celsius` a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).

let temp1 = new Celsius(-20);
let temp2 = new Celsius(32);
let temp3 = new Celsius(-2);

console.log(temp1.celsius, " is below the freezing temerature ", temp1.isBelowFreezing());
console.log(temp2.celsius, " is below the freezing temerature ", temp2.isBelowFreezing());
console.log(temp3.celsius, " is below the freezing temerature ", temp3.isBelowFreezing());



// a. Create a class called `Movie` that has properties for `name`, `year`, `genre`, `cast`, and `description`. Create an instance of your `Movie`

// b. Create an method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

// Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."

class Movie{
    constructor(name, year, genre, cast, description){
        this.name = name;

On a visit to Brideshead, the ancestral home, he falls in love with his friend's sister, Julia (Hayley Atwell). Howe-ver, as Charles' ties to Sebastian and family deepen, he finds himself at odds with their strong Roman Catholicism.",);

// ## Question 6

// Write a class Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
// It takes two number arguments: `x` and `y` parameters, which it should be saved to properties of the same name.
// Give the Vector prototype two methods, `plus` and `minus`, that take another vector as an argument and
// returns a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectorsâ€™ (the one in `this` and the parameter) x and y values.

// Add a method `getLength` to the prototype that computes the length of the vector ;
// that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

// a. Write a class called `Post` that has properties `datePosted`, `user`, and `text`.  Create an array of `Post` objects.
